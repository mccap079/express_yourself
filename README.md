===================

Face-gestural API created with [Beyond Reality Face SDK for javascript](https://github.com/Tastenkunst/brfv4_javascript_examples). See `/js/examples/face_tacking/restrict_to_center.js` for our ([Richard Lapham](https://github.com/Rlapham), [Andrew McCausland](https://github.com/mccap079)) added code, including all socket (via [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)) communication with server and gesture implementation. See `server.js` for server-side implementation.

Controls
--------

**POST**
Blink. Currently posts dummy image to server. Can post any data you'd like.

**GET**
Yawn. Pull the last image posted.

**DELETE**
Smile. Delete the last image posted. 

Data structure:

---------------

The only data stored are images of faces (in an aray) and a few vars regarding status and current state. Each image has a unique ID (**not really using at the moment**), a string identifying the specific feature (**currently not implemented, sorry**) and a url to its location on the server:

    {
        "images": [{
            "id": "int",
            "feature": "string",
            "url": "string"
        }, {
            "id": "int",
            "feature": "string",
            "url": "string"
        }]
    } 

`id`: unique id for each image posted. See `uuidv4()` in `/js/examples/face_tacking/restrict_to_center.js`.

`feature`: stringdenoting the subject of the image. Not automated in any way at the moment, just a custom string implementation.

`url`: location on the server.
