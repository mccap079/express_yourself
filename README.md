##Face-gestural API

###Control flows

####Control flow 1

When face is in frame (`isInFrame`) and `isFacingCamera`:

POST: capture image of face (see `face` object) and push to server

####Control flow 2 *(happens concurrently with control flow 1)*

When eyes are closed and user smiles (`areEyesClosed` && `isSmiling`):

Start session with this person

*Starting a session means camera starts listening for signals to do 1 of the following:*

 - When user is smiling (`isSmiling`):
	 - GET last face (`face` object) added to server
 - When user is "yawning" (`isMouthOpen`):
 	 - DELETE last face (`face` object) added to server
 - When user's eyes are closed and user is smiling (`areEyesClosed` && `isSmiling`):
	 - End session with this person

*When a session is terminated the camera goes back to listening for the "start session" command (`areEyesClosed` && `isSmiling`).*

####Data structure:

The only data stored are images of faces (in an aray) and a few vars regarding status and current state. Each image has a unique ID (**not really using at the moment**), a string identifying the specific feature (**currently not implemented, sorry**) and a url to its location on the server:

    {
        "images": [{
            "id": "int",
            "feature": "string",
            "url": "string"
        }, {
            "id": "int",
            "feature": "string",
            "url": "string"
        }]
        "isGettingFaces": "bool",
        "success": "bool",
        "status": "int"
    } 

The `isGettingFaces` bool returns `true` when the client (your camera) is currently capturing pics of your face and sending them to the server (see control flow 1). The `success` and `staus` bools are telling you if your request was successful or not.
